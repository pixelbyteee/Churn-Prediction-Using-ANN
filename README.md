📌 Churn Prediction using ANN

Customer churn is when a customer stops doing business with a company. Predicting churn is crucial for businesses to improve retention and reduce revenue loss.

This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or stay, based on their historical data. The model is deployed as an interactive web app using Streamlit.
